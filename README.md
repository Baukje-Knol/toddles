# Welcome to Toddles! #
  Toddles was created by the Geniue team in order to fulfil the specifications for our group assignment.
  We are students at the BSSA for Full-Stack Web Development.

  The idea behind Toddles is to provide parents and caregivers with a simple subscription-based platform where they may access
  night-time books and stories for reading pleasure for the children (age 0-9).

  This web-app has been designed with child-friendliness and simplicity in mind, as well as for use on desktops, laptops and tablets
  (preferably on landscape mode). Most of the competition uses static webpages which are full of text and not user-friendly.
